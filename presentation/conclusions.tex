  \frametitle{Conclusions}
  The community has already moved a long way with the previous V\&V exercises.

  We think there are ways to improve on this work by standardizing the way
  benchmark scenarios are described.

  Standard descriptions allow for automation of creating simulation-specific
  input files.

  We'd love to hear the communities ideas on ways to improve this. Come chat
  with us at the upcoming EPRI-sponsored workshop at Vanderbilt University
  scheduled for July 23-24, 2013.
