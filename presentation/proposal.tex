\begin{frame}[ctb!]
  \frametitle{Proposal : A Proof of Concept} We developed and implemented a
  proof of concept benchmark specification language in nominally three phases:

  \begin{enumeration}
    \item development of a proof of concept specification language for dynamic
      fuel cycles
    \item implementation of the specification for (simple) once-through base
      cases in both the INPRO and NEA/OECD benchmarks
    \item translation of the implementation into a Cyclus input file, and
      subsequently running the simulation

  Please note:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item this is a suggestion, not a complete solution
    \item there are definitely things missing from a full specification
    \item we see this as a starting point to begin a more community-wide
      discussion on how to address this issue
  \end{itemize}
